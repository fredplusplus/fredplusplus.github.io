Welcome to my personal blog. I am a software engineer @ Amazon.com. This site is used to document my life here in Seattle, both the fun part and work part. At work, my use Java/Javascript for the most part. At home, I LOVE to go hiking, reading geek news, watching random comedy shows, and flying in my Cessna 172!
