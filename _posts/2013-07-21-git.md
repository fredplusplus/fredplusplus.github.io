My team is swtiching all repositories from perforce to git. As part of it, I am forced to learn git and adpot the totally different ways of source control (which is far more superior than p4).

So here is some of my learning notes of git.

### Basic Commands
git status
git add <filename>
git commit 
git diff --staged
git pull
git log --graph --all

### Updating one file
1. update the file
2. git add <file>
3. git commit
4. git push

### Integrating with remote
git pull

### revert a file that's not committed
git reset HEAD -- <filename>

### revert a file that's commited
1. First figure out which version should it be reverted to: git log --graph --all
2. Copy the sha1 from the desired history
3. git checkout <sha1> <filename>

### Work on 2 branches at the same time
1. Find a point where you want to create branch: git log --graph --all
2. Go to that point: git checkout <sha1>
3. create 2 branches: 
	git branch b1    
	git branch b2
4. switch to one of them and work on it: git checkout <branchname>
5. Merge branch back to mainline:
	git checkout master
	git merge b1
	git merge b2
	git commit
	git push
